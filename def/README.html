    <p>This directory is a sparse copy of the def directory hierarchy.

    <p>It contains files that are specific to the VM version of the PHR, and are
not used for the GitHub version.

    <p>Contents are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><b>etc_httpd</b> -  a directory that contains configuration files that
        should be placed in the /etc/httpd directory on the VM.</li>
      <li><b>Gemfile</b> - a file used in setting up the Ruby Gems on the VM.
        It will be removed by the installation process.</li>
      <li><b>LICENSE.md</b> - the markdown version of the License that needs to
        go with the VM.</li>
      <li><b>packages</b> - the def/packages directory for the VM. This contains
        links to the external packages that are included in the VM.  The links
        will appear as broken links on a development machine, but should be
        valid on the VM.  (If they're not, there's a problem.)  This directory
        should be copied to the main def directory on the safe branch before
        creating a tar file of the safe branch for the VM.  (Once you do that,
        check out the safe branch again to restore the overwritten directory.</li>
      <li><b>proto1</b> - a sparse copy of the def/proto1 directory.  This
         contains files that differ from the majority of the safe branch files.
         These files should be copied to the proto1 directory of the safe branch
         before creating a tar file of the safe branch for the VM.   (Once you
         do that, check out the safe branch again to restore the overwritten
         files).</li>
       <li><b>README.html</b> - this file.  </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
