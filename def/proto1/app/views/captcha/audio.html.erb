<p>Help us keep spammers out and keep your account safe.  Click the
"Download the sound" link below and listen to it to find the spoken
words (amidst background noise).  This test changes from time to time,
but at the time of writing, what you will hear are three groups of
single-digit numbers, which you should type as numbers into the answer
box (and then press the "Submit" button).  Each group consists of three or four
numbers, sometimes said very slowly and sometimes nearly overlapping
each other, and you will hear plenty of distortion in the background.
If you have trouble hearing the numbers, you may use the "Get
another audio challenge" link to get a different sound file.  Also,
see the "Tips" section below.</p>

<h2>Tips for solving this audio test</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You will probably have to replay sections of the audio file several times
    to hear some numbers.  Turning the volume up loud helps.</li>
  <li>You only get one chance with each audio file.  After hitting Submit, if
    your answer was not correct, you will need to use the download link again
    to get the next audio file.</li>
  <li>If all else fails, you can request help via the <%= link_to SUPPORT_PAGE_NAME,
    new_contact_us_path %> page, and give us a way to contact you.</li>
