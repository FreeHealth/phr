    <h1>Risk Factors</h1>
		<p>
		This section identifies a number of factors that 
		are used to assess and reduce the risk of a variety of 
		poor outcomes. For example, women will be asked about pregnancy 
		because it is so important to minimize certain treatments 
		and tests (like x-rays) during pregnancy.
