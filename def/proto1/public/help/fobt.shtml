    <h1>Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)</h1>
	<p>
	A fecal occult blood test is used to screen for colon cancer and detects microscopic (occult) blood in the stool. When used for colon cancer screening it must be done yearly, and positive results should be followed up by colonoscopy. FOBT is also used in the evaluation of anemia to determine how the patient is losing blood.
