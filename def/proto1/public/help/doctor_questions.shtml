                <h2>
                Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>
               Keeping a list of questions to ask your doctors will help them properly assess your condition and ensure that you receive the most effective treatment. It is important to discuss all of the questions you have about your symptoms, tests, treatment alternatives, medications, risks, and outcomes with your physician as part of your overall health care plan.
