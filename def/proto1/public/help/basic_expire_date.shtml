    <h1>Expire Date</h1>
		<p>
		Enter the prescription&#39;s expiration date. This is the date 
		when the prescription runs out and does not allow refills.
	</p>
		<p>
		For short term medications, such as antibiotics for strep throat, 
		the expiration date is not important, as prescriptions for most 
		maintenance medications will expire in one year. For controlled 
		substances, like codeine or valium, the prescription normally 
		expires in six months or less. The expiration date will be on 
		the prescription bottle and will be called the <q>expiration date</q>. 
		Enter this date for long term medications so you can see 
		which medications will need a new prescription prior to the 
		expiration date.
