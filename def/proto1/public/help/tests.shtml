		<h1>Age- & Gender-based Health Screenings</h1>
		<p>
		Age- and gender-based health screenings include routine screening tests performed because of your age, gender, or other conditions. Examples are mammograms to detect early breast cancer, and colonoscopies to detect early colon cancer.</p>
                <h2>
                What do I need to know about age- and gender-based health screenings? </h2>

                    <li>
                    The NLM PHR will help you keep track of these preventive tests and remind you when you are due for each of them. You can view your reminders by clicking on the <b>Health Reminders</b> link at the top of the <b>Health Record Details</b> page of the PHR. The PHR offers reminders as a cue to you and your doctor about these preventive services, not as the final statement about which test is required and which is not. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
Only the most common preventive tests and screenings are displayed in this section of the PHR. Most other medical tests and health trackers can be recorded in your PHR using the <b>Add Tests Results & Trackers</b> link at the top of the <b>Health Record Details</b> page. Once a test or tracker has been added to a PHR using the <b>Add Tests Results & Trackers</b> link, the most recent recorded result for that test or tracker will be displayed in the <b>Previously Saved Tests & Trackers</b> section of the <b>Health Record Details</b> page. </li>
                    <li>
                     We use the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstfix.htm">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> and other esteemed sources for preventives tests and screenings. We provide links to these sources you can click on to explore the evidence for these recommendations. 
                    </li>
 <li>
                     In some cases, not all fields within the tests are displayed by default. If more fields are available, a <b>Show More</b> arrow will appear below the data entry line in the form. Click the <b>Show More</b> arrow to view additional fields or the <b>Show Less</b> arrow to hide additional fields. </li>
 <li>
                     Only the latest test results are displayed for each test. To view all previous results, click the <b>All Previous Values</b> button at the top of the test panel or select the <b>View Tests and Measures</b> link at the top of the <b>Health Record Details</b> page. The date of the last test done is displayed in the <b>Previous</b> field. 
                    </li> 
<li>
To add another test result for the same test, click the <b>Add More</b> button at the top of the test or tracker. </li>

                Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>
               Decisions about preventive tests and screenings are the responsibility of you and your doctor. Your doctor will know things about you and your health that could require these tests more frequently than the reminders might suggest. On the other hand, he or she will also know if there are reasons the test is not appropriate for you.
