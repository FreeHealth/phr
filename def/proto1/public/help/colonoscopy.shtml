    <h1>Colonoscopy</h1>
		
<p>A colonoscopy is used to screen for colon cancer. During a colonoscopy, your doctor looks directly at the inside of the large intestine (colon). When used for colon cancer screening, a colonoscopy should be done at least every ten years or sooner if any abnormalities are found.</p>
