		<h1>Preventive Tests and Screenings</h1>
		<p>
		<b>Preventive tests and screenings</b> include routine screening tests performed because of your age, gender, or other conditions. Examples are mammograms to detect early breast cancer, and colonoscopies to detect early colon cancer.</p>
                <h2>
                What do I need to know about the Preventive Tests and Screenings list? </h2>
<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    The NLM PHR will help you keep track of preventive tests and screenings and remind you when you are due for each of the screening tests. You can view your reminders by clicking on the <u>Health Reminders</u> link at the top of the PHR. The PHR offers reminders as a cue to you and your doctor about these preventive services, not as the final statement about which test is required and which is not. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     We use the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstfix.htm">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> and other esteemed sources for preventives tests and screenings. We provide links to these sources you can click on to explore the evidence for these recommendations. </li>
                     <li>
                     In some cases, not all fields within the test panels are displayed by default. If more fields are available, a <u>Show All Panel Values</u> link will appear above the data entry line in the form. Click the <u>Show All Panel Values</u> link to show additional fields or the <u>Show Fewer Panel Values</u> link to hide additional fields. </li>
 <li>
                     Only the latest test results are shown in each of the test panels. To view all previous results, select the <u>Flowsheet</u> link at the top of the <b>Test Results & Trackers</b> form.                     </li>           
              </ul>

                <h2> What kind of information should I enter? </h2>
		 <p>
                 The system will automatically populate this section of the PHR with recommended preventive tests and screenings based on your age, gender, and medical conditions. If you have had these tests performed, enter as much of the information as you know. </p>

                <h2>
                Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>
               Decisions about preventive tests and screenings are the responsibility of you and your doctor. Your doctor will know things about you and your health that could require these tests more frequently than the reminders might suggest. On the other hand, he or she will also know if there are reasons the test is not appropriate for you.
